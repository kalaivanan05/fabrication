#summary Fabrication change history.

----
=0.7.3=
 * added separate builds for flex3 (moxie) support
 * when injecting proxy if it is not registered framework will try to create & register. This should work fine if   proxy constructor has no params or has params wit default values

=0.7.2=
 * fixed injection mechanism in FlashMediator
 * fixed issues in new reactions mechanism 
 * introduced reflexive notifications interests via namespaces

=0.7.1=
 * added fabrication namespace ( http://puremvc.org/utilities/fabrication/2010 )
 * AirApplication/FlexApplication for spark and AirHaloApplication/FlexHaloApplication for halo architecture
 * Introduced FabricationModuleLoader and FabricationAirModuleLoader - simplified way to manage modules using ModuleManager
 * Introduced new Reactions registration approach
 * Introduced simply IoC for fabrication actors


=0.7=
 * Added support for Flex4 SDK
 * Rearranged repository layout
 * Introduced FlexUnit4 tests
 * Added AsyncFabricationCommand
 * Fixed ComponentResolver and reflexive mediator registration problem in spark components
 * Fixed reflexive registration problems in components with deferred child instantiation ( TabNavigator etc. )
 * New libraries:
       * included pureMVC core, pipes and async command libs into each distribution
       * separate distributions for air, flex and pure as3
       * recompiled using Flex4 SDK and AIR2 SDK official releases

=0.6=
  * Added support for Notification Interceptors.
  * Added support for automatic component Reactions.
	* Added support for multiple undo history stacks within the same application.
	* Added test-class ant macro for testing a single testcase.
	* Added launch-air-app and launch-air-swf ant macro for testing an application and swf in AIR.

=0.5.3=
  * Fixed issue with resolve for components with id and name.
  * Added config object to IFabrication and concrete implementations.
  * Removed default startup commands, instead an error is thrown if getStartupCommand is not implemented.

=0.5.2=
  * Fixed double disposal in FabricationView that was throwing an exception while unloading.

=0.5.1=
  * Moved ComponentRouteMapper into FlexMediator from the FabricationMediator.

=0.5=
  * Fixed memory leaks within the framework.
  * Fixed incorrect component route caching.
  * Refactored ComponentRouteMapper object to be cached at the facade level instead of globally.
  * Fixed incorrect notification caching in the FabricationMediator.
  * Refactored message routing internals to use an explicit TransportNotification instead of the earlier dynamic implementation.
  * Added FabricationModel to improve garbage collection of proxies.
  * Added FabricationView to improve garbage collections of mediators(Thanks Jason).
  * Added HashMap object to implement consistent cache management throughout the framework.
  * Implemented IDisposable in nearly all classes in the framework.
  * routeNotification now supports typed notifications with the syntax, routeNotification(new CustomNotification(�foo�))
  * Fixed invalid auto description regular expression in SimpleUndoableCommand.
  * FabricationFacade now provides a standard caching api to store objects within the scope of a facade instance.
  * Added platform specific swcs for flex and air.
  * Moved the build system into the framework and updated example builds.

=0.4.2=
  * routeNotification now supports dynamic *to* parameter. Valid values are string routes and IModuleAddress objects.

=0.4.1=
  * Fixed FlexModule to support direct loading with ModuleManager.
